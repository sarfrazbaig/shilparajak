        <p>Imagine you were asked to travel somewhere and a long address is written on your note without any direction given on it. You don’t have a access to go to map directly from the present screen of your mobile. Now all you have is to struggle between two screens just to reach the place. Would you still prefer to travel like
this 7-8 times in a day??
No!....Right?
I guess you can feel the pain of toggling between 2 screen while driving. We feel and realized it too. And then I took this as a problem to understand and come up with the simple and easy solution
for our drivers who are always on duty and facing the same issue.
</p>
<br>
      

      
            <h6><strong>Task Flow</strong></h6>
            <p>Let’s have a very brief overview of how our system works —
            The whole system is divided into 2 major part which easily define the business as follows.

                </p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <div class = "row center">
                <img src="task flow.svg" alt="Img not available" width = 100%>
              </div>

              <br>
                <br>
      

      
            <h5><strong>Understanding the problem</strong></h5>
            <h6><strong>Enhancing location navigation experience for ambassador</strong></h6>
            <br>
            <p>Well, the main challenge was to make changes in the existing designs without creating much of developement work, because as we can see the the problem looks small but has a bigger impact on wokflow. So I decided to focus on something which doesn’t bring any major changes to the existing system. It took me 2 days to thoroughly understand and think. 
                </p>
                <p>All the problem lies on the below screen. It doesn’t give a direct option to go to map and check for direction. Also as we can see there is no space to add one new ”navigation” icon to the existing card.</p>
                <p>How can I accomodate?</p>
                <p>Think......Think......Think</p>
                <p>Let’s have a look at the screen ——</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <div class = "row center">
                <img src="problem.svg" alt="Img not available" width = 90%>
              </div>

              <br>
              <br>



     

      
            <h5><strong>Solving the Problem </strong></h5>
            <p>So, I came up with an idea of introducing Interaction design to the system.Well-executed interaction design plays a huge role in the implementation of great UX, and is indisputably one of the fundamentals of UX design principles.
            </p>

            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>Successful interaction design employs simple, clearly defined goals, a strong purpose and an intuitive UI.
                </li>
                <li>In an effort to keep interactions simple and easy, goal-driven interaction design puts nothing more than the absolute minimum necessary in front of users in order for them to complete a task.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h6><strong>Fitt's Law</strong></h6>
            <p>Believe it or not, this law comes from early studies looking at human muscle movement and targeting of telegraph operator and production line task performance, and was later adapted to HCI (human-computer interaction). It basically says: “The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.”

            </p>
            <p>In simpler terms, it’s about how far and how large a target is, and how close it is in relation to other targets. Shorter mouse movements or taps are better — it is always faster to click or swipe a target if it is closer to your starting position. Related tasks should also be in close proximity to each other so users don’t have to dart around the screen interacting with the UI.</p>
            <p>Fitts’ law can accurately predict the amount of time it takes to move to, and select a target. A target can be a button, a dropdown or some other interactive element on a screen. If it’s too far, too small or clickable elements are too close together, the efficiency and usability of the UI is greatly reduced.
            </p>
            <br>


                <h6><strong>So, what I did finally?</strong></h6>
                <p>I dropped the idea of accomodating icons next to “phone icon” infact I decided to remove one “phone icon” from there and show user a bottom drawer card to select primary and secondary numbers.
                </p>
                <p>I came up with an idea to show navigation icon on a stepper control which is on left side of the screen.
                Since the stepper is used to show the different stages of the journey, I thought to make the use of it and added the navigation icon on it which can directly take them to the google map.</p> 
                <br> 


                <h6><strong>Now, how does it work? </strong></h6>
                <br>
                <p>As soon as you reach the particular stage, the stepper with navigation icon will be appear and start blinking. <strong>Yes!...it will blink.</strong> So that it can catch the attention of user easily. The idea was to make it intuitive and keep it similar to user understanding. I used same navigation icon which is used in everywhere.
                We all are used to google maps, keeping icons similar to it serves the purpose well.</p>
                <p>Since, you cannot expect driver to spend time on reading while driving, so making it moving and interactive can help them out.</p>
                <p>Just like this ——</p>
                <br>
                <br>

                <div class = "row center">
                <img src="solution.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 100%>
              </div>
              <br>
              <br>
              
            

              <h5><strong>Curious about the result?</strong></h5>
              <p><strong>Well, It had worked !........</strong>and if you are wondering how drivers interacted, they are happy to use the feature and adapting it nicely without raising any complaints on the same. They find it
              easy to use and ofcourse...it wasn’t a surprise for them because the interface still looks same
              with a better user experience. </p>
              <br>
              
              <h6><strong>What they liked most?</strong></h6>
              <p>Not to struggle between 2 phone call icons for calling customer while driving and obviously easy navigating between screens and map :)

              </p>
              <br>

              
              <p>Designing a good user experience hinges on the interactions within it. Good Interaction Design forms an integral part of good UX Design. But, understanding all of the concepts that contribute to successful Interaction Design and knowing where to start can be an overwhelming feat.</p>
              
              
              <p>It is about making the connection between a device, its interface and the user; it facilitates the actions we want to take with any given system. Every time you make a choice on a digital device, interaction design is what responds; it makes a framework of text and objects useful, learnable and ultimately, intuitive. It delivers that almost human element that makes technology enjoyable and pleasant to interact with.</p>
              <br>
              
              <p>Good interaction design centers on human connection.
              </p>
              <br>
              
              <p>Interaction design isn’t only about how interfaces behave, it’s about how people behave, and then adapting the technology accordingly. You first must understand your users on a level where you can determine what they want and expect, and then you have to determine how to facilitate those needs within the technological constraints of your product or service. This is an integral part of building a positive user experience.</p>
