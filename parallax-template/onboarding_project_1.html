            <h5><strong>About 21North</strong></h5>
            <p>21North is a path-breaking concept in the Indian Auto After Sales Industry : aimed at solving the perennially existing problem of vehicle owners finding trustable service providers and sacrificing valuable personal time in managing their vehicle needs.
            </p>
            <br>
      

      
            <h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
            <p>Well , So I started my career as a UX Designer in 21North Europ Assistance.As I joined this company the first project knock my door is Ambassador Onboarding Application and I started looking for a reason , why this tool is necessary for this company. Since we are operating in 11+ cities in India dealing with varoius OEM’s. We have our Ambassador helping us in providing the service in better way. This application will help our recruiter to maintain and manage all the details of our ambassador digitally. This is a data management tool for ambassador. This tool will be used in 3 ways
              <ol>
                <li>Walk-in data capture</li>
                <li>Trainer Interface</li>
                <li>Recruiter Interface</li>
              </ol></p>
            
            <br>

      
            <h5><strong>Problem Statement</strong></h5>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>As of now 21North Europ Assistance is operating
                11+ cities and recruiting ambassador across india.
                For recruitment of ambassador all the data were used to captured using pen and paper and it was such a pain to manage large number of data physically. So, thats where we come up with this solution.</li>
                <li>And also one of the major reason to come up with this solution was to track the dropout of the ambassador working
                with us. Since dropout of an ambassador results in huge business loss and it was a main concern for business owner. And our main aim was to figure out the way to track the reason of ambassasdor dropout so that we can find out
                the way to overcome it.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
           
            <br>
            <br>
            

            

            <h5><strong>Insights</strong></h5>
            <p>Considering the factors discussed above, we made sure that we had an empathetic understanding of the problem while curating the experience for the onboarding flow.
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Difficulties in Managing Paperwork</strong>
                Before the onboarding tool came up, all the
                data used to captured in an excel sheet manually which is a hassel and painful process for recruiter. During the process, many times the information was lost in verbal communication due to lack of documentation. Also, it was a time taking process to maintain these data and refer to it again when needed.
               </li>
               <br>
               <li><strong>Droupout rate of an ambassador</strong>
               There are various reason for ambassador’s dropout while the onboarding is in process
               or even after joining the company, To aware of the these reason we are collecting the data from ambassador by asking them questions about their background.Since the product is in beta and we we are still trying to collect more data and identify the behaviour and background of the ambassador to overcome this issue.</li>
               <br>

               <li><strong>Lack of tool to track dropout reason</strong>
               A chronological way to collect information collection was needed. Specific information had to be recorded specific to each stage of the onboarding process, for easier tracking of the ambassador's onboarding process. Recording data is also important as ambassadors who do not qualify the test later come back to re-apply. It would be easier for the recruiters to track where they were eliminated and to understand if they have improved from the last time.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <br>

            
            <h5><strong>Product Plan</strong></h5>  
            <p>
                
            Data points such as past criminal records, family history, area of inhabitation, and so on are crucial data points, which we thought was necessary to profile the drivers in various categories. This would help us find the problematic category so that hiring can be stopped earlier. </p>
            <p>This data is also very crucial for the company so that we can maintain a repository of all the walk-in ambassadors in case the ambassadors re-apply and also for identification purpose.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Onboarding tool is our internal onboarding product. So to begin with the design process we started interviewing the recruiters and the stakeholders to know the edge of the problem from their perspective. After few interview session with the stakeholder and recruiters we explored many scenerios through card sorting. Finally we came up with the following solution : - </p>

            <div class = "row center">
                    <img src="onb_1.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 80%>
            </div>

            <br>
            <br>
            
                
            

            
                
                
                <h5><strong>Design Process</strong></h5>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class = "row center">
                        <img src="onb_2.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 80%>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h5><strong>Task Flow and User Journey </strong></h5>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class = "row center">
                        <img src="onb_3.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 80%>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
               

                <h5><strong>Phase 1 - Wireframes</strong></h5>
                <p>We began with wireframing stage where we implemented the solution in a design form. During wireframing the main intention was to segregate the data, there was a huge volume of data that had to be entered. It was still challenging filling up so many fields.Also, from the UX perspective, it was important for us to make those forms interesting so that that the user does not feel tired while filling them up.</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <div class = "row center">
                        <img src="onb_4.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 80%>
                </div>

                <br>
                <br>



                <br>
                <br>

                <h6><strong>These are just few of the important relevant screens from the wireframe stage.</strong></h6>
                
                <p>Post the wireframing stage we had a peer review session where we re-evaluated our expectations. We also had an intense discussion with our technical team on the fuctionality aspect and the excel documentation was updated accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>Team’s main motive at this point was to roll it out as soon as possible so that manual work stops and we start getting data for evaluation. This was looking like a good point for the team to kick start the project in the next level. </p>
                
                <br>
                <br>
                
                <h5><strong>Phase 2| Hi-Fidelity Mocks</strong></h5>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class = "row center">
                        <img src="onb_5.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 80%>
                </div>

                <br>
                <br>

                <h5><strong>Job Type Screen</strong></h5>
                <br>

                <h6><strong>Thought Process for illustration</strong></h6>
                <p>Since this is a tool used for onboarding of driver and technician, the idea was to present this page in creative and fun way. Coveying serious message in funny and innovative ways certainly sells and that’s exactly what we are wrapping “Job type page” with to give the user a rather pleasant experience.</p>

                 <h6><strong>Pen and Paper Process</strong></h6>
                <p>So we tried to draft different stories to show the driver and technician relationship in a one single page because we wanted them to come on a single platform to work togethere.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class = "row center">
                        <img src="onb_6.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 80%>
                </div>

                <p>The concept here resonates with the idea of the tool. Selecting job type page tells you a story of a driver and technician. The above illustration tells a story of a driver who is strugging with his car and looking for technician. He ultimately found a technician on a road and calls him for help.
                </p> 
                <p>The bright colors blue, purple and grey contrast is used to maintain the consistency with onboarding tool.
                Simple wordplay is used in the text that is perfectly woven around the concept. It provide “Technician” and “Driver” option to select.</p>
                <p>Overall this page serves its purpose along with being creative and definetly proves to be an escape from usual job type page that makes you go sigh!</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class = "row center">
                        <img src="onb_7.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 80%>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class = "row center">
                        <img src="onb_8.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 80%>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class = "row center">
                        <img src="onb_9.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 80%>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p>Gathering data is easy but leveraging it to create impactful insights is what makes it powerful. A dashboard exactly serves that piurpose. A dashboard is not simply an amalgamation of graphs but it is a story told through data.</p>
                <p>The above dashboard is specially designed for the stakeholders where they can see all the data in one go. The data were shown with the help of funnel, pie chart and bar graph. Since pictorial images helps user to understand more clearly than the words do.</p>
                <p>In this dashboard, we included few major categories like Recruitment funnel which is giving the clear idea of how many ambassador walk-in for the interview, how many really got selected after the process.</p>
                <p>With help of pie chart , it can be easily find out the reason why ambassador were dropping out.</p>
                <p>Also, using the bar graph it is easy to find out the overall status of ambassador.</p>
                <p>Still there are many ideas to work and improvise on the dashboard in order to provide modified version. We are working towards it to make it for colorful and user friendly.</p>

                <h5><strong>Usablity Testing</strong></h5>
                <p>Just after a release, we conducted a usability testing session with some of our stakeholder who are going to use it on a daily basis. We asked them to use the tool right from the beginning and also asked to perform a task, while they were doing so, we were observing their interaction and behaviour thoroughly.</p>
                <p>Soon after they finished using the tool and completed the task,</p>
                <p>We asked them about their experience,
                If it feels easy for them to perform the task? How does it feels? Is it still a painful process?</p>
                <p>We recorded it all, below is the link of test videos ——</p>
                <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DJVXajrCA5gWq3v4ICTuDAejd526ZRfc?usp=sharing">Test Video Links</a>

                <h5><strong>What I Learnt</strong></h5>
                <p>By the end of this project I learnt various UX methods like Ethonography in which I studied about the group of targeted user, User interview, Card sorting. Well I spent a lot of time on visual design and it came with lot of learning. I tried to incorporate all my learning during UX research into visual design.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5><strong>Future Trajactory of the Product</strong></h5>
                <p>For analyzing data, a large volume of data is required. Currently, data is being migrated from excel sheets to the database. Once, migration is complete and enough data is available, the dashboard can provide a variety of information such as driver behavior data, whether not a driver can be hired — thereby saving costs on the hiring process, the effectiveness of recruitment agencies, and so on.Currently, this product is on beta testing.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5><strong>Future Directions</strong></h5>
                <p>Below, I list future directions I could take the deliverables here if I were a Visual designer here : </p>
                <p>Understand more about Onboarding Tool by talking to our recruitement specialist, all the stakeholders, and via user research → visual design and including pictorial graphics that resonates with them</p>
                <p>Continue iterating on the Dashboard Analytics and wireframing/building hifi mocks for the same.</p>
                <p>Designing and modifying the dashboard analytics graphs and funnel visually and more from ux perspective.</p>
