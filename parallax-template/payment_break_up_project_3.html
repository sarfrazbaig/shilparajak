        <h5><strong> 21North Europ Assitance</strong></h5>
        <p>21North | Europ Assistance is empowering OEM authorized automobile dealers with technology-driven solutions to deliver superior customer experience. One of the major stakeholders in the business is our drivers (called as ambassadors).They essentially act as runners for executing vehicle pick up and drop services for the OEM customers. We help them execute the tasks using our solutions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
      

      
            <h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
            <p>Since the backbone of the business is our drivers, we have our internal driver application called as Ambassador Application. Well now our ambasssador app needs a little introduction. Through this application our driver get the task assigned for the day. It also has a section called payout structure, in which they can see their total income and incentives for each task completed in a day and a month. 
                </p>

            <h6><strong>Lack of transparency on the payout structure </strong></h6>
            <p>Since the backbone of the business is our drivers, we have our internal driver application called as Ambassador Application. Well now our ambasssador app needs a little introduction. Through this application our driver get the task assigned for the day. It also has a section called payout structure, in which they can see their total income and incentives for each task completed in a day and a month. 
                </p>
                <br>

            <h5><strong>Solving the Problem </strong></h5>
            <p>We wanted our redesign to solve problems with speciﬁc business constraints, and we knew it was impossible to do so without delving into user problems ﬁrst. 
                
                First comes the framework - To achieve this, we pinned some critical thumb-rules before embarking on our redesign journey: 
                <ol>
                    <li>To be data driven</li>
                    <li>To empathise with user and business requirements</li>
                    <li>To incorporate the new solution into existing design</li>
                </ol>
            
                    To put the framework to use, we started white-boarding our in-app user ﬂow. In the journey graph, we noticed a good number of ambassador were dropping-oﬀ because of the transparency in payout structure. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <h6><strong>Understanding the user pain points</strong></h6>
                <p>The second step was to understand our users’ pain points with the existing UX in the payout structure. To dig deeper into this, we reached out to our users directly. We adapted both qualitative and quantitative methods to get to the root of every problem in the picture. We started interviewing ambassador to reach the root of the cause. Here are some feedback we got from them:
                    <br>
                   <i> “ No clariﬁcation were being made if they raised any issue ”</i> <br>
                    <i>“ Diﬀerent incentives are not shown properly ” </i><br>
                    <i>“ Deduction are not clearly highlighted ”</i><br> 
                    <i>“ It was all confusing and diﬃcult to understand for a driver ”</i>
                    <br>
                    With all the research and data at our disposal; we realised that redesigning the payout structure ﬁrst will not only enhance the user experience, but also solve a critical business problem
                    </p>

                <h6>So our payout structure page used to look like this </h6>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class = "row center">
                <img src="old payout.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 100%>
              </div>
              
            <p>
              The original page consists of too many component on a single page It was diﬃcult for our ambassador to understand those terms and language. Too many information without any conclusion ?
              <ol>
                  <li>Base Payout</li> 
                  <li>Login Incentive</li> 
                  <li>Early Morning Incentive</li> 
                  <li>Late Night Incentive</li>
                  <li>Weekly Incentive</li> 
                  <li>Deduction</li> 
                  <li>Penalties</li>
              </ol>
              </p>
              <br>
              <br>

              <h5><strong>Understanding and Deﬁning each problem</strong></h5>
              <p>Before jumping into the screen designing process we wanted to have a clear picture of our ambassador pain points and goals. We summarized our learning to this three primary problems to form a common understanding of what we were trying to solve.  </p>
              
              <h6><strong>Problem1 - Verbose Information</strong></h6>
              <p>Too much of scroll and scroll. Also the amount of content written on this page without any ﬁnal conclusion leds to no where. The terms and language used in the content is diﬃcult to understand for a driver who is just looking for a total payout
                </p>

              <h6><strong>Problem 2 - Cognitive Overload</strong></h6>
              <p>The page was overﬂowing with tasks that required explicit actions from the ambassador. The arrow used is giving no clear idea for its existence</p>
              
              <h6><strong>Problem 3 - Prolonged Payout Highlights</strong></h6>
              <p>Too many actions and redundant information caused users to spend more than 2 minutes just to see and ﬁnd out their total payout and incentives. Time and energy both are wasted but still no information.</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              
              <h5><strong>New Design</strong></h5>
              <p>Since we were redesigning the application from UX perspective and also making it visually appealing. We thought of adding more value to it by gamifying the experience of entire payout structure for our ambassador. So we came up with the idea of GOAL Page The idea of having a goals page originated from the fact that our drivers had too many issues understanding the frequently changing pay-out structure. Also, we wanted to come up with a system which would elevate their motivation levels to execute more tasks per day. Using gamiﬁcation, we set challenges. The driver partners can see the progress of their tasks and how much incentives they can earn through a progress bar. The system also tells the driver if he has committed any mistake which may have caused a penalty. This keeps them informed about all their actions throughout the day. We also decided to display the payout structure on the home page for them to view the pay-out details whenever they wanted.</p>
              
              
              <br>
              <br>
                <div class = "row center">
                <img src="new payout.svg" alt="old_payout scren" width = 100%>
              </div>

              <h5><strong>Winning Result ?</strong></h5>
              <p>The idea of designing the payout page is to keep it simple and clear. Just to use minimum no. of elements to understand easily. We wanted it to display the payout information more in numerical rather than showing too much of unnecessary content. Also, it should be just one click away from any detail information and ofcourse no scroll. Main challange was to show the Incentive and Deduction at the same place and making it immediate visible and focused at one go. Showing all Deduction and Penalties in red color serves its purpose well and it was easy to distinguished in the list. Also, Total Payout is highlighted and shown in bold so that the user can see it as soon as they land on that page. It gives motivation and immediate result of an action.  
                  After the implementation, Now we were ﬁnally ready to roll out the design to our ambassador These lightweight and progressive changes, helped our ambassador cultivate new habits slowly and steadily, making the redesign bearable for them. So we waited for a month to analyse the impact of our design - </p>

                  <h6><strong>And, ﬁnally it had worked.</strong></h6>

                  <p>The issue raised from our ambassador enquiring about their payout structure had fall drastically. Now, they have clear idea and understanding of their payout. Everything was crystal clear and the gamiﬁcation has worked quiet well providing motivation to take up more task and earn incentive everyday. Also the dropout of an ambassador because of this reason has decreased.  
                    <i>Doesn't it feels good to design something which leads to create a good environment for our user ? 
                      <br>
                      Yes! Even if you fail, think it and make it better.</i>
                       </p>
                       <br>
                       <br>

              <h5><strong>Future Directions</strong></h5>
              <p>Below, I list future directions I could take the deliverables here if I were a UX designer here : Understand more about Ambassador Application by talking to our drivers, and via user research → visual design and including pictorial graphics that resonates with them Continue iterating on the Payout Structure page and wireframing/building hiﬁ mocks for the same.</p>
